Context Switching

The entire point of Sprints is to cut out the inefficiency of context switching while still allowing the project flexibility and agility.

Software development (or data science, or mathematics, or STEM similar work) requires colleagues to load vast amounts of technical information into their brain and keep this loaded for long enough to actually do the work.  

Only 5% of a developers job is really writing code, the other 95% is often spent loading contexts into memory.  If we can cut down the amount of time spent loading information to say even just 80%, then we have effectively hired 3 more developers.

If a developer is asked to switch from one task to another task, all this information falls out of their head.  Sometimes a developers first few hours of a task can be just making sense of the task and loading up relevant information into their head.  Therefore if a developer keeps switching context every few hours, no work will ever get done.

Moreover, the ability to load context into memory compounds day on day, so it goes something like this:

1st 30 minutes - 0.2x productivity1st hour - 0.5x productivity1 day - 1x productivity2 days - 2x productivity3 days - 4x productivity

So a developer might say that a task X say, takes 1 week "uninterrupted & without context switching", now if you interrupt a developer say every day with some other task it could take about 3 weeks instead (not even including the time of the ‘other task’).  Interrupt them every hour and it will take 6 weeks.
