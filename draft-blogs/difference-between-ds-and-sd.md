I claim that the difference between Data Science and Software Development can be succinctly captured by the difference between < and = respectively. That is Data Science (DS) corresponds to the Order relation, while Software Development (SD) corresponds to the Equality relation.

What I mean by this is that in DS success is defined by a function satisfying a certain threshold, while in SD success is defined by a function satisfying an equality.  For example a Fraud Detection algorithm may require that *less than* 100 frauds are missed a year, while a sorting algorithm requires that the resulting list is precisely a sorted list.

Furthermore I claim there really is nothing else to it. All beliefs that DS is more than "just checking f(x) > y" or that SD is more than "just checking f(x) = y", is in fact lack of clarity of thought regarding the objective.

Lack of clarity of objective is the number one cause of delivery failure in both DS and SD. When a problem is clearly defined, the problem tends to solve itself - rather quickly!



Is, in a nutshell, the difference between < and = respectively.

Acceptence tests.

Does this mean Data Science really is more complex than Software Development? I don't think so.
