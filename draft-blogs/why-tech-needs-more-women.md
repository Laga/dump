Observe the title carefully.  It's "Why does *tech* need more women?" not "why do we need more women in tech".  I'll breifly argue that there are scientific, logical and even mathematical reasons that more women in tech would make the tech we build higher quality, help us build it faster and while spending less money.

I do not wish to undermine the importance of equal opportunities, or the general shortage of people in tech.  Indeed there are already many articles explaining how tech can be a good career choice for women. Some are based on how working from home some portion of the week or day is quite easy in fields like data science and software development when compared to other careers. **NOTE** that this is only true if the company has sensible infrastructure!  The company needs fast internet, a good video call tool like Google Hangouts, **good email i.e. Gmail**, a good chat tool i.e. Slack, good light weight PM tools like JIRA & Trello, **and of course Git**.  Unfortunately many companies choose stupid remote collaboration tools that create friction, which slows down intellectual and collaborative momentum.  So please, if the reader is in the procurement or IT department choose good collaboration tools to make working from home easy. In some loosely connected way you will be helping women get into tech.

Anyway, from what I have observed and read in the tech industry is that the single best predictor of the quality, cost and speed of tech projects is the degree to which the collaborative elements of Agile methodologies have been implemented.  Let's reiterate what these are from the Agile manifesto:

"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"

"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"

"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."

"The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."

"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."

It took me a while to learn this importance because I love working alone, that's why I choose to study maths and take a career in tech.  I was under the dellusion that I would be able to forever sit an isolated cave mentally exploring platonic and virtual worlds.  Indeed I do get to do this, but certainly not all the time.  When we stay isolated for too long the things we build tend to be lower quality, have unbalanced style, and take longer. The two main reasons are:

1. There is too much knowledge and experience in the tech world to be possessed by a single person.  Each person will only have a tiny fraction of potential knowledge and experience.  Furthermore it tends to be quite disjoint between people, i.e. different people have surprisingly little overlap.
2. Software, engineering and data science projects are too massive to be done effectively by single person.

Therefore the ability, skill, experience, knowledge or intelligence of single individual does not necessarily determine the outcome, rather the *collective* intelligence of a team - the "C factor".

Now according to some scientific research http://cci.mit.edu/mciresearchpage.html 

"This “c factor” is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members, but it is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and ..."

let's take a theoretical digression before we complete this quote.  If we consider Information Theoretic or computational models of intelligence, particularly in terms of Kolmogorov Complexity, this is mathematically obvious.  The power, efficiency and effectiveness of a programming language comes from the composability of it's parts, not the power of the average or maximum power of the individual parts.  Two brilliant examples are Bash (or linux) and Scala, Bash is a super awesome language because nearly every single word or phrase in the language is designed in such a way that it can be concisely composed and piped together.  In Bash one cannot really do much with just one or two of it's features, especially when compared to the monolithic applications of a certain other operating system. Nevertheless overall it is significantly more powerful and effective because each feature can be easily combined with others.

So finally we have

"... and the proportion of females in the group."

I conjecture that females often facilitate the composability of individual intellects, let's call this skill "Kolmorogov Composition".  I'm not an evolutionary biologist, nor a psychologist, so I'm not going to attempt to explain why females seem better at this but I can see that this is probably true.  So given that females are better at this, and given the overwhelming evidence and logic that justifies the importance of Kolmogorov Composition in tech teams, the conclusion is a profound need for more women in tech *for the betterment of tech*.

Please share, I don't usually ask, but if this post does actually manage to convince a single female to enter a career in tech then this post will actually be more than procrastination.
