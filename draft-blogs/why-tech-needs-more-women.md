The company needs fast internet, a good video call tool like Google Hangouts, **good email i.e. Gmail**, a good chat tool i.e. Slack, good light weight PM tools like JIRA & Trello, **and of course Git**.

So please, if the reader is in the procurement or IT department choose good collaboration tools to make working from home easy. In some loosely connected way you will be helping women get into tech.
