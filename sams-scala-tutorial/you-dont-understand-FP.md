# You Don't Understand Functional Programming nor even OOP

## Abstract:

Powerfully Statically Typed Functional Programming is going to become more and more necessary for the future of automation, but it's still misunderstood and underused. Partial exceptions appear to be in concurrency and bug averse applications like aerospace, defense and finance.

An old programmer, like PDP-7 old, once said to me "you won't truly learn language theory until you build your own compilers".  Only recently I followed him up on that, and indeed he couldn't be more right. 

I still include myself in the confrontational generic "you" of the title since I am yet to finish building a compiler, but I still wish to share the myth busting learnings so far. Which will include

 - "Multi-Paradigm" languages like Scala, F#, Python, C# & Java 8 are really OOP plus syntactic sugar.
 - Using lambdas and 2nd-order functions doesn't mean you're doing FP
 - OOP was useful, but not anymore, PLEASE stop doing OOP

## Introduction
 
## In Haskell
 
You don't access a field in data using `myData.myField`, you actually call a function `myField` on `myData` like this: `myField myData`.

In Haskell you don't have inheritence, you have typeclasses. In Scala you kind of have the same thing, but since Scala provides no way to introduce infix notation, it's not as useful.
