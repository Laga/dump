 - FP is to programming as XP/agile is to process, OOP is to programming as BUFD/waterfall is to process

SOLID Subjectivity

SRP is obviously subjective

Open-Closed just means you can't modify an library, so this isn't really a principle of OOP it's a principle of build tools/IDEs

Dependency inversion:

> As you have seen in the example project, you only need to consequently apply the Open/Closed and the Liskov Substitution principles to your code base. After you have done that, your classes also comply with the Dependency Inversion Principle. 

Interface Segregation:

Basically means don't extend virtual interfaces where you do not need to implement all the methods.
