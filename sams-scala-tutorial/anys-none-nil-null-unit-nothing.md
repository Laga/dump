Prerequisite should be AnyRef, Any, AnyVal

`Any` is a supertype of anything.  `AnyVal` is any  

`Nothing` is a subtype of every type and nothing is an instance of `Nothing`

Analogy: the empty set is a subset of every set but nothing is a member of the empty set

`Null` is a subtype of every reference type, the only instance of `Null` is `null`, which one could say overrides every method with `throw new NullPointerException()`.
