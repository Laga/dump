# Basic Security - Aimed at ALL Ages (but mainly 8+ year olds)

## 0 Intro

As technology progresses gradually all of ones property will be accessible digitally.  It is therefore extremly important that young people understand basic security.  In the future a sufficiently savy hacker will be able to steal everything you own if you do not follow these instructions. Learn young.

The Notes section at the end aims to provide _some_ explanation.

## 1 Passwords

### 1.1 Master Passwords

This section will cover passwords for your 

 - Operating System (logging into your computer) 
 - and your email (we assume gmail). 
 
If you use **Mac** or **Linux** it is advised that these passwords _are the same_ for your computer and gmail. If you use **Windows**, the passwords should be _different_.

### 1.1.1 Invention

The younger the child, the simpler the password ought to be, but loosely use the following system. Then see section 1.1.3

1. Pick a sentence at least 7 words such that:
  1. 2 words are random 2 digit numbers, use dice
  2. The words form a silly sentence, try to be as ridiculous as possible and pick long words. E.g. `57 giant potatoes leaked 14 lanterns happily`
  3. Invent a simple system to separate the words, e.g. a full stop, or the last letter is upper case, etc, e.g. `57,gianT,potatoeS,leakeD,14,lanternS,happilY`. The more complicated the better, but make sure you can remember it!  **Better start with something simple**
2. Write it down REALLY clearly in big letters on a sheet of **paper with a pen**.

### 1.1.3 Rotation & Complexity (when to change)

Since younger children will have data of virtually no value then start with simpler passwords.  Nevertheless _some_ complexity is desirable to train the child from an early age how to use secure passwords.  When the child gets their first bank account with online banking it's time to change password. Next should be 16, after 16 **only ever change a password** if it's believed it has been compromised.

## Multi Factor Authentication

## Alternative Authentication Systems (like finger id)

All these new fancy techniques like finger recognition or voice recognition can be convenient for many use cases, but are not as secure as good passwords.  The more complex the technique of authenticating the higher the probability it will contain a flaw or exploit either now, or in the future.  A password guarantees mathematically a certain level of security.  Furthemore it's unclear what the longevity of such techniques are, fingers grow and change, will it always work?

Always use the simplest possible thing that works, because that thing will work most predicably and for the longest amount of time.

## 2 Locking Your Computer

Get into the habbit of locking your computer whenever you leave it unattended whereever you are.  Ensure the timeout is active, but it is not of great importance how long it is, it should be less than 12 hours.

## 3 Logging Into Email

Only login to email on your own computer or a computer you trust.  You can only trust computers where you know that the user goes to the same lengths as you to keep your computer secure.

## 4 Anti-virus Software

Is utterly useless.  Contrary to their publicity. Avoid installing any anti virus software, they are likely to **decrease** the security of your machine. (See notes)

#Â Notes

This section contains explanations to the above instructions.

## 1.1

Mac, Linux and Gmail can be considered secure platforms (the BSD variants of Linux being the most secure). Windows cannot be trusted as highly so keep your password for a Windows system separate.

**In general you want to minimise the number of passwords you remember** less is more.  Simplicity is key.

### 1.1.3

A password only needs to be as complex as the data it protects.  

Avoid changing passwords because this introduces complexity.  Complexity introduces work arounds and room for mistakes.  Keep the system simple **and stick to it**.  Large corporations often ask employees to change their passwords regularly, this is why large corportaions are frequently on the news for getting hacked - most have NO IDEA about security.  

Large corporations cannot be trusted as examples of how to secure systems. They employ IT staff to handle security that do not have degrees in STEM. Corporations often **only** care about insurance, not about security.  Being insured and being secure are entirely different things.  Insurance companies also tend to employ uneducated people to determine their rules.  Crucially insurance polcies will require "anti-virus" software, maybe this is because the "anti-virus" software companies pay the insurance companies to do so - though incomptence is more likely.  The only **genuine** way to keep a corporation secure is to hire top STEM talent and frequent penetration testing from multiple independent testers - the smaller the tester, the better.

Anti virus software will likely run as root or admin on your system.  Introducing any program and allowing to run 24/7 on your machine as root/admin is a bad idea.  Just because some software
